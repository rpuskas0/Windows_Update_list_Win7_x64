__IMPORTANT:__
_Further updating of this list is from now on discontinued, as end of support for Windows 7_
_is within 6 months and putting further effort into maintaining such a list is now_
_nonsensical. I hope you enjoyed using it as much as I enjoyed maintaining it._



Here you will find a list of Windows 7 (x64) updates in XML format. This list was
originally created for Windows Update Downloader (http://www.windowsupdatesdownloader.com/)
by Steven4554, but has not been updated since March 2015. This list is an updated
version of Steven4554's and contains most update packages to this date. If you are an
integrator, you will find this most useful, otherwise please feel free to ignore this.

__NOTE:__ You might need to compress this file using zip and rename the extension from
.zip to .ulz to make it work with the downloader.

__DISCLAIMER:__ This list is for testing purposes only. It may not contain all updates
necessary to patch your system completely, so the recommended way to keep your machine
up-to-date is to use the built-in system update tool. The update tool not only patches
your system, but other software as well (like office software), so keep this in mind.
Do NOT use this list unless you absolutely know what you are doing and willing to take
risks! If your machine becomes compromised due to a missing update you were warned.
